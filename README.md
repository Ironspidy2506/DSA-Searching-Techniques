## Available Searching Methods 📑

1. 📏 **Linear Search**  
   A straightforward method that checks each element one by one until the target is found. Suitable for unsorted arrays or small datasets.

   - ⏳ **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - 🛸 **Space Complexity**: O(1)

2. 📶 **Binary Search**  
   A faster approach that requires the array to be sorted. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the element is found.

   - ⏳ **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
   - 🛸 **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## Why Use These Methods? 🌟

- **Linear Search** is simple but can be slow for large datasets.
- **Binary Search** is much faster, but only works on sorted arrays.

## Files 📂

- `LinearSearch.java`  
  Contains the implementation of the linear search algorithm.
